REVIEW SPRINT 4
    -Add showtimes 
        -Why asked to continue when selecting add showtimes (due to not being able to escape) so its a temp fix
        -Go all the way back when you do not add the movie - THIS IS OK
        -Dates in past - THIS IS OK
        -Date needs to be in format (dd-mm-yyyy) - EUROPEAN format
        -More feedback needs to be provided when entering times with already screening
        -Show dates that are added 
        -The hall you have chosen is not available on these dates, ask for confirmation if others need to be added. 

        -When not in the list - THIS IS OK
        -Adding new movie, summary goes wrong (invalid input) Better feedback
